              <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
            
              <p>I'm from Morgan Hill, California. I have lived there all my life, there's nothing much to do and it's  a pretty sad city but it's my hometown.</p>
            
              <h2>What I Want To Do</h2>
            
              <p>I want to be an art teacher outside of school. I don't want anything to do with school after I graduate college, if I even decide to go. Since a very young age, I have always wanted to be doing art for the rest of my life. It's what I love.</p>
