    <h1>Design a Band Challenge</h1>
    <h2>Convicts</h2>
    <img src="./img/portfolio/design_a_band/albumcover.png" alt="How Much Is Enough?">
    <h2>Band Biography</h2>
    <p>Before Convicts was turned into a band, lead singer, Eduardo Lopez, had gone through a rough time for <br> </br> 
    about 8 months. His best friend and drummer, Rubykens, had tried to get him on the right path of his life <br> </br> 
    through music and art but failed. Eduardo had been to jail many times for drug use before he had been <br> </br> 
    placed in a prison for bank robbery because he went broke and needed the money for more drugs. <br> </br>
    Eduardo was sent to the prison for 5 years. He had Ruby visit him in prison to help turn his life around <br> </br> 
    when he got out. He thought of many things he could do when he gets out and actually study or get a <br> </br>
    good job. During recreational time, he got the idea of forming a band from an older inmate. The older <br> </br> 
    inmate was named Fred, he had been banging on buckets and had a rhythm to it. Eduardo noticed that <br> </br> 
    he had been tapping his foot to the beat and later ended up humming. He quickly ran to the telephone <br> </br> 
    and dialed Ruby’s number. He told her his idea and how he wanted his band to be. He told her that he <br> </br> 
    wanted her to be his drummer and create music forever. This is a dream he wanted. <br> </br>

After his 5 years, Ruby had set up equipment in her basement to prepare. Eduardo had written some <br> </br> 
songs while he was in his bunk and brought it over to Ruby’s house. He was so excited about his newly <br> </br> 
prepared songs that he ended up spreading the word to old friends from high school. Everyone was so <br> </br> 
excited and happy for Eduardo that they immediately started helping. Eduardo reunited with many old <br> </br> 
friends like, Amelia Rodriguez. She helped him book a show at a cafe. A lot of Eduardo’s friends showed <br> </br> 
up and cheered him on. That’s when Eduardo and Ruby decided to make the band, Convicts, their first <br> </br> 
album titled, How Much Is Enough? Which meant how much of this idea is enough because Eduardo <br> </br> 
was so excited he was turning his life around.</p>
